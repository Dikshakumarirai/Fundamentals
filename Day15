 What is a Comparator in java?
Consider the example where we have an ArrayList of employees like( EId, Ename, Salary), etc. 
Now if we want to sort this list of employees based on the names of employees. Then that is not possible to sort using the Collections.sort() method.
We need to provide something to the sort() function depending on what values we have to perform sorting. Then in that case a comparator is used.

Which among String or String Buffer should be preferred when there are lot of updates required to be done in the data?
StringBuffer is mutable and dynamic in nature whereas String is immutable.
Every updation / modification of String creates a new String thereby overloading the string pool with unnecessary objects. Hence, in the cases of a lot of updates,
it is always preferred to use StringBuffer as it will reduce the overhead of the creation of multiple String objects in the string pool.


What happens if the static modifier is not included in the main method signature in Java?
There wouldn't be any compilation error. But then the program is run, since the JVM cant map the main method signature,
the code throws “NoSuchMethodError” error at the runtime.

What happens if there are multiple main methods inside one class in Java?
The program can't compile as the compiler says that the method has been already defined inside the class.
