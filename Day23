How to implement Stack and Queue using ArrayDeque in Java?
The ArrayDeque in Java provides a way to apply resizable-array in addition to the implementation of the Deque interface. 
It is also known as Array Double Ended Queue or Array Deck. This is a special kind of array that grows and allows users to add or remove an element from both sides of the queue.
ArrayDeque class implements Queue and Deque interface which provides it a lot of methods and functionalities.

How to use ArrayDeque
ArrayDeque is a class in Java Programming Language that implements the Queue and Deque interface that further extends the Collection Interface. 
ArrayDeque has all the methods of Queue and Deque such as add(), remove(), addFirst(), addLast(), removeFirst(), removeLast(),
and many others inherited from these interfaces.
It is very easy to use ArrayDeque class because of the ease of these methods provided in Java.

Difference between Queue and Deque (Queue vs. Deque)?
Queue:
The queue is an abstract data type or linear data structure from which elements can be inserted at the rear(back) of the queue and elements can be deleted from the front(head) of the queue.

Queue Data structure
Queue Data structure

The operations allowed in the queue are:
insert an element at the rear
delete element from the front
get the last element
get the first element
check the size of the queue
check if the queue is empty or not
Deque:
The double-ended queue is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue from which elements can be inserted or deleted either from both front(head) or rear(tail) ends.

Deque Data structure
Deque Data structure

The operations allowed in deque are:
insert an element at the back
Insert an element at the front
delete the element at the back
delete the element from the front
get the last element
get the first element
check the size of the deque
check if the deque is empty or not
