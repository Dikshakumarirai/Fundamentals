How regex is used in Java?
A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern. 
Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations. Java does not have a built-in Regular Expression class,
but we can import the java.util.regex package to work with regular expressions.

How to validate regex in Java?

Why regex is used?
Regular expressions are particularly useful for defining filters. 
Regular expressions contain a series of characters that define a pattern of text to be matched—to make a filter more specialized, or general.

What algorithm is used with regex?
backtracking algorithm
Most library implementations of regular expressions use a backtracking algorithm that can take an exponential amount of time on some inputs.
Such inputs can be surprisingly simple.

Which language is used in regex?
Ans. A regular expression can be defined as a language or string accepted by a finite automata. We know that a finite automata consists of five touples {Q, Σ, δ, q0, F}.
