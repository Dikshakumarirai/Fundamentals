What is Tree ?
A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.

Why Tree Data Structure?
Other data structures such as arrays, linked list, stack, and queue are linear data structures that store data sequentially.
In order to perform any operation in a linear data structure,
the time complexity increases with the increase in the data size. But, it is not acceptable in today's computational world

Tree Terminologies
Node
A node is an entity that contains a key or value and pointers to its child nodes.

The last nodes of each path are called leaf nodes or external nodes that do not contain a link/pointer to child nodes.

The node having at least a child node is called an internal node.

Edge
It is the link between any two nodes.
