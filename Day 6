DSA(Data Structure and algorithm):

What is an asymptotic analysis of an algorithm?
Asymptotic analysis of an algorithm defines the run-time performance as per its mathematical boundations. Asymptotic analysis helps us articulate the best 
case(Omega Notation, Ω), average case(Theta Notation, θ), and worst case(Big Oh Notation, Ο) performance of an algorithm.

 What is hashmap in data structure?
Hashmap is a data structure that uses an implementation of a hash table data structure which allows access to data in constant time (O(1)) complexity if you have the key.


What is the requirement for an object to be used as key or value in HashMap?
The key or value object that gets used in the hashmap must implement equals() and hashcode() method.
The hash code is used when inserting the key object into the map and the equals method is used when trying to retrieve a value from the map.



JAVA(Programming Language):-
 Why Java is platform independent?
Java is called platform independent because of its byte codes which can run on any system irrespective of its underlying operating system.


 Why Java is not 100% Object-oriented?

Java is not 100% Object-oriented because it makes use of eight primitive data types such as boolean, byte, char, int, float, double, long, short which are not objects.
