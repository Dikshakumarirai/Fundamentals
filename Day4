How is java different from C++?
C++ is only compiled langauge ,whereas java is compiled as well as an interpreted langauage.
java programes are machine independent where as c++ programes can only in the machine in which it is  compiled.

pointer are used in C++/c. why does not make  use of pointer?
pointers are quite compilicated and unsafe to use by beginers programmers. java focuses on code simplicity and uses of poinetrs can make  it challenging
pointer utilize can also cause potential errors moreever security i salso compromised if pointers  are used  because the users can directly access memory with 
the help of pointers.


What are different operations available in stack data structure?
Some of the main operations provided in the stack data structure are: 

push: This adds an item to the top of the stack. The overflow condition occurs if the stack is full.
pop: This removes the top item of the stack. Underflow condition occurs if the stack is empty.
top: This returns the top item from the stack.
isEmpty: This returns true if the stack is empty else false.
size:  This returns the size of the stack.


What is a queue data structure? 
 queue is a linear data structure that allows users to store items in a list in a systematic manner.
 The items are added to the queue at the rear end until they are full, at which point they are removed from the queue from the front. 
 Queues are commonly used in situations where the users want to hold items for a long period of time, such as during a checkout process.
 A good example of a queue is any queue of customers for a resource where the first consumer is served first.
 
  What are the applications of queue?
  Following are some applications of queue data structure:

Breadth-first search algorithm in graphs
Operating system: job scheduling operations, Disk scheduling, CPU scheduling etc.
Call management in call centres
