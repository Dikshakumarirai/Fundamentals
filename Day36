1. Why pointers are not used in Java?
Java doesn’t use pointers because they are unsafe and increases the complexity of the program. Since, Java is known for its simplicity of code, adding the concept of pointers will be contradicting. Moreover, since JVM is responsible for implicit memory allocation, thus in order to avoid direct access to memory by the user,  pointers are discouraged in Java.

2. What is JIT compiler in Java?
JIT stands for Just-In-Time compiler in Java. It is a program that helps in converting the Java bytecode into instructions that are sent directly to the processor. By default, the JIT compiler is enabled in Java and is activated whenever a Java method is invoked. The JIT compiler then compiles the bytecode of the invoked method into native machine code, compiling it “just in time” to execute. Once the method has been compiled, the JVM summons the compiled code of that method directly rather than interpreting it. This is why it is often responsible for the performance optimization of Java applications at the run time.

3. What are access modifiers in Java?
In Java, access modifiers are special keywords which are used to restrict the access of a class, constructor, data member and method in another class. Java supports four types of access modifiers:

Default
Private
Protected
Public
Modifier                          Default	  Private	  Protected	  Public
Same class	 	                     YES	     YES	      YES	        YES
Same Package subclass	              YES	       NO	        YES      	YES
Same Package non-subclass	            YES	     NO          YES       YES
Different package subclass            	NO	    NO         	YES   	 YES
Different package non-subclass	        NO	     NO        	NO	      YES

4. What is an object in Java and how is it created?
An object is a real-world entity that has a state and behavior. An object has three characteristics:

State
Behavior
Identity
An object is created using the ‘new’ keyword. For example:

ClassName obj = new ClassName();

5. What is Object Oriented Programming?
Object-oriented programming or popularly known as OOPs is a programming model or approach where the programs are organized around objects rather than logic and functions. In other words, OOP mainly focuses on the objects that are required to be manipulated instead of logic.
This approach is ideal for the programs large and complex codes and needs to be actively updated or maintained.
