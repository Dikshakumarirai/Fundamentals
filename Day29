1. What is the default value of Array?
Any new Array is always initialized with a default value as follows

For byte, short, int, long – default value is zero (0).
For float, double – default value is 0.0.
For Boolean – default value is false.
For object – default value is null.

2. Can we declare array size as a negative number?
No. We cannot declare the negative integer as an array size.

If we declare, there will be no compile-time error.

However, we will get NegativeArraySizeException at run time.

 3.When will we get ArrayStoreException?
It is a runtime exception. For example, we can store only string elements in a String Array.
If anybody tries to insert integer element in this String Array, 
then we will get ArrayStoreException at run time.

4. Can we add or delete an element after assigning an array?
No it is not possible.

 5. Is there any difference between int[] a and int a[]?
No difference both are the legal statement.
