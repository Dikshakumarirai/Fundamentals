Explain the process behind storing a Variable in Memory?
A variable is stored in memory based on the amount of memory that is needed. following are the based steps  followed to store variable:-
The required amount of memory is  assigned first
Then it is stored  based on the data structure being used.
using concepts like dynamic allocation  ensure high efficeincy and that the storage units can be accessed on requirements in real time.


Can you explain the difference between file structure and storage structure?
File Structure: Representation of data into secondary or auxiliary memory say any device such as a hard disk or pen drives that stores data which remains intact until manually deleted is known as a file structure representation.

Storage Structure: In this type, data is stored in the main memory i.e RAM, and is deleted once the function that uses this data gets completely executed.
The difference is that the storage structure has data stored in the memory of the computer system, whereas the file structure has the data stored in the auxiliary memory.

JAVA:-
 Why is Java a platform independent language?
Java language was developed in such a way that it does not depend on any hardware or software due to the fact that the compiler compiles the code and then converts it to platform-independent byte code which can be run on multiple systems.

The only condition to run that byte code is for the machine to have a runtime environment (JRE) installed in it
2. Why is Java not a pure object oriented language?
Java supports primitive data types - byte, boolean, char, short, int, float, long, and double and hence it is not a pure object oriented language.
