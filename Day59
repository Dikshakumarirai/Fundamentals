How to use SHA 256 in Java?
In Java, we can use MessageDigest to get a SHA-256 or SHA3-256 hashing algorithm to hash a string.
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest. getInstance("SHA3-256"); byte[] result = md. digest(input);
...
Java supports the following SHA-3 algorithms:
SHA3-224.
SHA3-256.
SHA3-384.
SHA3-512
.
How do I convert SHA256 to hash? OR
How to Generate SHA256 Hash?

Step 1: Enter the Plain or Cypher Text.
Step 2: Click on Generate SHA256 HASH Online.
Step 3: Use Copy to Clipboard functionality to copy the generated SHA256 hash.

How SHA256 is calculated?
Image result
For SHA-256 these are calculated from the first 8 primes. These always remain the same for any message.
The primes are firstly square rooted and then taken to the modulus 1.
The result is then multiplied by 16‚Å∏ and rounded down to the nearest integer.

What can SHA 256 be used for?
SHA-256 is used in some of the most popular authentication and encryption protocols, including SSL, TLS, IPsec, SSH, and PGP.
In Unix and Linux, SHA-256 is used for secure password hashing. 
Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin use SHA-256 for verifying transactions.
