How to Generate MD5 Checksum for Files in Java?
MD5 and SHA are the two most widely used checksum algorithms. 
You must ensure that you use the same algorithm that has been used to generate the checksum when checking checksums.
For example, the MD5 checksum value of a file is totally different from its SHA-256 checksum value.

Difference between MD5 and SHA1
MD5 stands for Message Digest and SHA1 stands for Secure Hash Algorithm square measure the hashing algorithms wherever 
The speed of MD5 is fast in comparison of SHA1â€™s speed.

However, SHA1 provides more security than MD5. 
The construct behind these hashing algorithms is that these square measure accustomed generate a novel digital fingerprint of knowledge or 
message that is understood as a hash or digest.
